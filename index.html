  <h2>Bird & Butterfly - The incredible story</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>On the magical summer of 2016, the simple bird met the colorful butterfly and since then nothing was ever the same again. <br>
    It all started with a message, quite early in the morning:

        Hi Orlando,

My name is Duong, a little Vietnamese girl, a solo backpacker on the way fulfilling the dream of exploring the world. Sorry for sending the request in a rush because I travel without fixed plan and by hitchhiking so  can not know exactly the departure. I reached to Faro today and have no place to stay yet so can you please help me for staying? 

Since I was small, I started being interested in watching the Map and talked to myself that one day I will go around the World. 
When I still have lived in Vietnam I've often traveled by motor because I am a biker and I love to experience, challenge myself. I also love trekking, photography and writing. I have been writing as a freelance writer. I've working as a banker for more than 4 years then inOctober, 2014, I decided to stop my job and started doing my dream. I've traveled alone around Southeast Asia for almost 1 year then being back to Vietnam in August then applying Visa to Spain, to learn language and started my new exploration. I travel with a small budget so most of time I do hitchhiking. And thanks for Couchsurfing for letting me have great chance to get the help of people about accommodation and know much more about the life of locals, food, culture which made my trips more interesting and memorable.

This time, in my heart, I think a lot about Portugal, the country I wanted to go so much, the country of a beautiful language which I've known through Cesaria's song .!! So I can not wait more, I've decided to skip my course and heading to Portugal and hitchhiking along the country.. I wonder if you can please help me to stay for 1 night or a couple of day?

Im a faithful , humoros and quite romantic person. I hope i could become a guest of you. I always respect your private space and will not make you feel annoy about me.

I am looking forward to hear from you very soon!!

  <p>The Bird was quite surprised with such an elaborate text which he never had the pleasure to read from a fututre host, plus she was romantic! <br> What the bird was completely oblivious was how romantic the buterfly was... It was beyond is understanding. <br> Driven by curiosity the bird could not resist and quickly replied with a positive answer. <br><br>From that moment forward started a beautiful story which you will have the opportunity to follow on this website, which is dedicated to my buterfly, baby, fofinha, lovely turtle and many other names to come. &#9829;</p>
